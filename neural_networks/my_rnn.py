  Args:
    cell: An instance of RNNCell.
    inputs: The RNN inputs.
      If `time_major == False` (default), this must be a `Tensor` of shape:
        `[batch_size, max_time, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such
        elements.
      If `time_major == True`, this must be a `Tensor` of shape:
        `[max_time, batch_size, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such
        elements.
      This may also be a (possibly nested) tuple of Tensors satisfying
      this property.  The first two dimensions must match across all the inputs,
      but otherwise the ranks and other shape components may differ.
      In this case, input to `cell` at each time-step will replicate the
      structure of these tuples, except for the time dimension (from which the
      time is taken).
      The input to `cell` at each time step will be a `Tensor` or (possibly
      nested) tuple of Tensors each with dimensions `[batch_size, ...]`.
    sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`.
      Used to copy-through state and zero-out outputs when past a batch
      element's sequence length.  So it's more for correctness than performance.
    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.
      If `cell.state_size` is an integer, this must be
      a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.
      If `cell.state_size` is a tuple, this should be a tuple of
      tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in cell.state_size`.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state and expected output.
      Required if initial_state is not provided or RNN state has a heterogeneous
      dtype.
    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
      and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
      time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
      while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
    swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
      but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs
      which would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
      performance penalty.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors.
      If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
      If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
      Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids
      transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
      most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
      accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".

  Returns:
    A pair (outputs, state) where:

    outputs: The RNN output `Tensor`.

      If time_major == False (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
        `[batch_size, max_time, cell.output_size]`.

      If time_major == True, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
        `[max_time, batch_size, cell.output_size]`.

      Note, if `cell.output_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of integers
      or `TensorShape` objects, then `outputs` will be a tuple having the
      same structure as `cell.output_size`, containing Tensors having shapes
      corresponding to the shape data in `cell.output_size`.

    state: The final state.  If `cell.state_size` is an int, this
      will be shaped `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.  If it is a
      `TensorShape`, this will be shaped `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
      If it is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or `TensorShape`, this will
      be a tuple having the corresponding shapes. If cells are `LSTMCells`
      `state` will be a tuple containing a `LSTMStateTuple` for each cell.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell.
    ValueError: If inputs is None or an empty list.
